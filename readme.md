# Live Blog Backend

## Description

This is the backend for creating and managing live blogs. It includes RESTful API endpoints for managing blogs and posts, and uses Socket.io for real-time updates.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the necessary environment variables (e.g., MongoDB URI, JWT secret).
4. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server using nodemon.

## Dependencies

- Express
- Mongoose
- Passport
- Passport-jwt
- Socket.io
- Nodemon (for development)
- Eslint (for development)

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following environment variables:

```
MONGO_URI=your_mongo_uri
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
PORT=your_server_port
```

## Running the Application

1. Ensure MongoDB is running and accessible.
2. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.

## Unit Tests

- To be added (example: using Mocha and Chai for testing the API endpoints)

## API Endpoints

### Auth Routes

- `POST /api/auth/register`: Register a new user.
- `POST /api/auth/login`: Login a user.
- `POST /api/auth/refresh`: Refresh JWT token.

### Blog Routes

- `POST /api/blogs`: Create a new blog (Editor only).
- `PUT /api/blogs/:id`: Update a blog (Editor only).
- `DELETE /api/blogs/:id`: Delete a blog (Editor only).

### Post Routes

- `POST /api/blogs/:blogId/posts`: Create a new post in a blog (Editor only).
- `PUT /api/blogs/:blogId/posts/:postId`: Update a post in a blog (Editor only).
- `DELETE /api/blogs/:blogId/posts/:postId`: Delete a post in a blog (Editor only).

## Socket Events

- `postCreated`: Emitted when a post is created.
- `postUpdated`: Emitted when a post is updated.
- `postDeleted`: Emitted when a post is deleted.

## Middleware

- Authentication and role-based access control using JWT and Passport.

## Example Usage

### Creating a Blog

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/blogs \
-H "Authorization: Bearer <JWT_TOKEN>" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{

}'
```

### Creating a Post

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/blogs/<blogId>/posts \
-H "Authorization: Bearer <JWT_TOKEN>" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
  "title": "My New Post",
  "description": "This is the description of my new post."
}'
```

## Test Data

- Create a few blogs and posts using the provided API endpoints or the editorial interface to see the functionality in action.

## Scripts
